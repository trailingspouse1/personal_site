<h2>About Diana Mahmoud</h2>
<div>

 

  <p> <img src="assets/images/diana.jpg" alt="Diana Mahmoud">After a career in both traditional and digital media in the United States, Diana Mahmoud gave up life as she knew it for the possibility of life as it could become. Seven years later as a seasoned and serial expatriate, she has lived (mostly) happily in four countries on three continents and currently resides in Singapore. </p>

  <p>In 2013 while living in Singapore, she started her own business, BeakSpeak Media. She worked as a consultant helping business owners who feel intimidated by the ever-changing digital world to have both the knowledge and confidence to improve their online presence and customer engagement. 

 <p>In her spare time, Diana writes when the mood strikes her and because it&#39;s cheaper than therapy. You can read about her expat adventures at <a href="http:\\taleofatrailingspouse.com" target=_"blank">Tale of a Trailing Spouse .</a></p>
